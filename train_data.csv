"So this group helped my family and I so much when the hurricane hit. Now we need some help again. We cannot afford to stay in this hotel any longer, its just too much. We have 2 days left here, and that's it. The homeless shelters are either full, or don't except a family as large as us. Its my wife, my 3 young children and myself. I'm calling everyone i can that offers help, and they are just feeding me phone numbers to call, and that's just leading to more phone numbers! Its overwhelming. My wife has full time work, and I am going for a job interview here in about an hour. We just need somewhere to go for like, 30 days so we can save up move in cost. That's the only thing holding us back! We are thinking about hitting a camp site or something, but go figure its raining its butt off every day here in Greensboro. If anyone can house my family for just 30 days around Greensboro, It would give us the jump we need to finally get ahead of all this. We are clean, quiet, and VERY respectful. We have a running, insured vehicle, and neither of us do any drugs or drink. My children are angels and you'll fall in love with them, i guarantee it! Any and all resources anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all again, and god bless.",1

"Lauren Kilroy-Ewbank and her family - Shawn, Eleana and Anaïs - have lost their home at Malibou Lake due to the Woolsey fire.  Her family is safe (thank God) but they lost everything in their home when they were evacuated at 1:28am. Family and friends have been reaching out to offer support so I started this page for those of you who would like to donate monetarily.

"My name is Catherine Heng and I am a relative of the family whose 3 family house was destroyed during a house fire in Lynn, Massachusetts this Thanksgiving.  Our holidays, which usually mean shining a light on gratitude, was extremely bright this year as everyone escaped safely out of a burning house.  While emergencies and accidents are bound to happen, we would've never expected that something this tragic would've happen to us.  Today, I am extremely humbled and extending my hand out on behalf of my 17 family members - 3 floors of families, including my grandma - who lived in this house.  The funds will be used to purchase clothes, food and permanent shelter. ",1

"Hi Family and Friends! On July 23rd a large amount of rain came pouring down in a very short amount of time causing the entire bottom level of my Mom's split level home to flood. She has lost everything on the bottom level (the main living area) and is in the process of ripping out carpert, drywall, and throwing away all furniture and belongings that were on the bottom level. Insurance is not covering any of the damage, and as you can imagine this has brought on the huge burden of trying to replace everything 100% out of pocket. ",1
"We wanted to inform you of a horrible event that has occurred within the NeoTract family. In Santa Barbara on January 9th, there were severe rain storms that resulted in flash floods. Terrible timing given the recent fires.  Kim Cantin and her family were horribly impacted by this storm. We are sorry to report that her house was completely washed away and more heartbreak is that her husband Dave and her 16-year old son Jack are still missing. Thankfully her 14-year old daughter was rescued by firefighters on January 9th.  We are working with the local community to offer as much support to Kim and her family as quickly as possible.",1
"My sister Terri and her family have lost everything during this hurricane flooding in Houston. They were rescued this morning and taken to a shelter. Their house when they left was 5 ft. Deep in water....they were never able to afford insurance. My sister and her husband are in their 70's and he was continuing to work to make ends meet. I set my goal high, but that will get them started in recovery when the flood waters recede. They even lost their car.  I hope FEMA will step in and come to Houstons rescue.  Please pray for all involved.",1
